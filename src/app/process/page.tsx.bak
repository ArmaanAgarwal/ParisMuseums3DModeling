              <p className="leading-relaxed">
                The Performance Museum is conceived as a hybrid that combines
                three distinct architectural languages: the Louvre's procession
                and axis logic, the Pompidou Centre's exposed structural
                systems, and the grounded materiality of a brick archive wing.
                This combination creates a building that is both ordered and
                dynamic, both transparent and material, both ceremonial and
                functional.
              </p>
              <p className="leading-relaxed">
                The concept responds to the museum's program: three levels that
                tell the story of performance from origins to data to futures.
                Each architectural element supports this narrative: the axis
                creates a clear arrival sequence, the exposed systems reveal the
                building's logic, and the brick wing provides a grounded
                counterpoint that connects the museum to material tradition.
              </p>
              <p className="leading-relaxed">
                This is not a "warehouse box." It's a deliberate composition that
                demonstrates how architecture can be organized, expressed, and
                made readable. Every element has a purpose, every material has a
                role, and every space supports the museum's mission of exploring
                performance through objects, data, and experience.

                The collection is organized through a clear hierarchy: Level → Zone
                → Exhibit → Object. This structure allows visitors to understand
                both the broad narrative arc and the specific stories within each
                section. Each level builds on the previous, creating a cumulative
                understanding of performance evolution.
              </p>
              <p className="leading-relaxed text-white/80">
                Exhibits are organized thematically, with each exhibit presenting a
                clear thesis supported by carefully selected objects. This approach
                ensures that individual artifacts are not isolated curiosities but
                part of a larger story about how we understand and enhance human
                performance.

                The guided tour creates a linear narrative path that ensures visitors
                encounter all key concepts in a logical sequence. However, the
                structure also supports non-linear exploration: visitors can dive
                deep into specific exhibits, follow connections between related
                objects, or explore by theme, era, or technology type. This dual
                approach—guided and free exploration—accommodates different learning
                styles and visit preferences.
