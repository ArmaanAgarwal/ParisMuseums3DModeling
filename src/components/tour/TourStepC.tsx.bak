                If the Performance Museum were built as a physical structure,
                it would synthesize three distinct architectural approaches,
                each contributing essential meaning to the visitor experience.

                Louvre Logic: The Central Axis
              </h3>
              <p className="mb-4">
                The museum's primary circulation follows a strong central axis,
                creating clear orientation and a sense of procession. This axis
                connects the arrival sequence through the building, providing
                wayfinding and establishing calm, ordered geometry.
              </p>
              <p className="mb-4">
                <strong>Why this matters:</strong> The central axis reflects the
                museum's narrative structure—a clear progression from origins
                through data to futures. Just as the Louvre's axis creates
                discipline and clarity, our axis creates a coherent journey
                through performance history. The axis also represents the
                "measurement line"—the progression from qualitative to
                quantitative understanding.

                Pompidou Energy: Exposed Systems
              </h3>
              <p className="mb-4">
                One facade reveals the building's technical infrastructure:
                exposed structure, color-coded systems, and visible circulation.
                This transparency reflects the museum's theme of making the
                invisible visible—showing how performance technology works.
              </p>
              <p className="mb-4">
                <strong>Why this matters:</strong> The exposed systems metaphor
                directly connects to Level 2's mission: revealing how sensors,
                data, and measurement work. Just as the Pompidou makes
                infrastructure visible, our museum makes performance technology
                transparent. The color-coded systems (pipes, frames, circulation)
                mirror how we categorize and understand performance data.

                Brick Archive Wing: Grounded Warmth
              </h3>
              <p className="mb-4">
                A distinct brick-clad wing houses archival materials and
                historical collections. This grounded, tactile space provides
                contrast to the technical facade, creating a warm, bookish
                interior that connects to the museum's historical foundations.
              </p>
              <p className="mb-4">
                <strong>Why this matters:</strong> The brick archive wing
                represents Level 1's historical foundation—grounded, tactile,
                connected to the past. While the Pompidou facade shows the
                future of technology, the brick wing shows the continuity of
                human achievement. The warmth and materiality create an intimate
                space for contemplation, just as Level 1 invites reflection on
                ancient principles that remain relevant.

                How Architecture Supports the Narrative
              </h3>
              <p className="mb-4">
                The three-level vertical journey mirrors the three-act narrative:
                Level 1 (grounded, historical) connects to the brick archive
                wing. Level 2 (technical, analytical) connects to the exposed
                Pompidou facade. Level 3 (future, experimental) extends upward
                into the sky gallery. The central axis provides the thread that
                connects all three, just as measurement connects all three eras
                of performance.
              </p>
              <p>
                Light is used strategically: calm daylight on Level 1 for
                contemplation, dramatic spotlights on Level 2 for technical
                displays, immersive projection on Level 3 for future experiences.
                Circulation supports the story: visitors ascend through time,
                from ancient foundations to future possibilities.
