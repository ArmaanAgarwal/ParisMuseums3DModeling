Which foods provide proteins?,"Meats, fish, eggs, dairy, legumes and nuts, whole grains"
"What are vitamins and minerals, and why are they essential for the body?","Vitamins/Minerals: essential micronutrients needed for metabolism, growth, immune function, and health."
"Which vitamins are fat-soluble, and which are water-soluble?","Fat-soluble: A, D, E, K. Water-soluble: C and B-vitamins"
Name two major minerals and two trace minerals.,"Major minerals: Calcium, Phosphorus (others include sodium, potassium, etc.). Trace minerals: Iron, Zinc (others include copper, manganese, selenium, iodine)."
What are the main functions of water in the body?,"Fluid balance, nerve impulses, temperature regulation, transport nutrients, excretion of waste."
"What are non-nutrient compounds found in foods, and give two examples?",Non-nutrient compounds: Probiotics and Phytochemicals.
"What are probiotics, and what roles do they play in the gut?","Beneficial bacteria that support gut health, digestion, immune function; present in yogurt, fermented foods."
"What are phytochemicals, name two classes, and one health role?","Classes: Flavonoids, Carotenoids (examples). Role: antioxidant effects and cardiovascular protection."
"What are the three main steps of going from food to nutrients in the GI tract: digestion, absorption, and elimination?","Digestion (breakdown), Absorption (nutrient uptake), Elimination (waste removal)."
What is the cephalic phase of digestion?,First thought/anticipation of food; senses trigger GI preparation and digestive juice secretion.
What are the roles of the mouth in digestion (mechanical and chemical)?,Mechanical: chewing to break food; Chemical: saliva and salivary amylase begin carbohydrate digestion.
What enzyme begins carbohydrate digestion in the mouth?,Salivary amylase
What is peristalsis and what does it accomplish in the esophagus?,Rhythmic waves of muscle contractions that move the bolus toward the stomach.
What is chyme and where is it formed?,A semi-liquid mixture of partially digested food formed in the stomach.
What are the roles of the stomach in digestion and what substances are absorbed there?,"Chemical digestion of proteins and lipids; some water, fluoride, lipids, and lipid-soluble drugs (e.g., aspirin, alcohol) are absorbed."
What are the three sections of the small intestine and their primary roles?,"Duodenum, Jejunum, Ileum; major site of digestion and absorption."
"What are the roles of the liver, gallbladder, and pancreas in digestion?","Liver produces bile; Gallbladder stores concentrate bile; Pancreas secretes digestive enzymes and hormones (insulin, glucagon)."
How are nutrients transported from the small intestine to the bloodstream and liver for water-soluble vs fat-soluble nutrients?,"Water-soluble nutrients: transported via blood to liver. Fat-soluble nutrients: transported via lymph (villi) to the bloodstream, then to the liver."
What is the gut microbiome and what are two benefits to health?,Communities of gut microbes; benefits include regulation of appetite/energy metabolism and immune support.
What is intuitive eating and how does it relate to self-regulation in nutrition?,Intuitive eating emphasizes listening to hunger/satiety cues and self-regulation in food choices.
What is the energy molecule produced by cells and which organelle manufactures it?,ATP produced by the mitochondrion.
